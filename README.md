Liri Bot is a CLI tool that allows you to use a select amount of commands to find additional information. The abilities are:
 - "spotify-this-song" which allows you to find the name of the song, the artist, the album and a link to the song on Spotify for any song
 - "concert-this" allows you to find the upcoming concerts of any artist. It provides date, location and the name of the venue
 - "movie-this" allows you to find advanced details on any movie you search, such as release year, Rotten Tomatoes rating, and more
 - enter the command "do-what-it-says" for a surprise

To use, in your terminal window, simply type "node liri.js" followed by one of the above commands, and then a song, artist or movie of your choice
